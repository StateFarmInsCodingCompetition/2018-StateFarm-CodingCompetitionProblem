	I slightly modified the api to use a SearchPredicate interface and added default methods in it in order
	to do logical operations of the queries. That way, you can to more complex searches of nodes.
	
	Furthermore, I made a small cli program for doing these queries. I don't really have thaaaat much time to explain, but basically,
	you enter a query where
	
	"category"="value" matches locations where that SearchCriteria would match
	"category"!="value" matches locations where that SearchCriteria does not match
	
	and("category1"="value1" "category2"="value2") requires both must be true
	or("category1"="value1" "category2"="value2") requires at least one be true
	
	so or(namestartswith=wendy amenity=place_of_worship) matches a bunch of stuff but
	and(namestartswith=wendy amenity=place_of_worship) matches nothing obviously (unless you worship frosties I guess)
	
	
	And yes! these should nest (it's just that it might be buggy :/  )
