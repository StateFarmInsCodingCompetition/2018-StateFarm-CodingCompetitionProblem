Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events?

Overall the competition was enjoyable and well-structured; we would have liked to see more tasks to
complete, as we felt that we had easily enough time to do all the provided ones, but not quite enough
time to develop a whole GUI, leaving us only implementing one minor enhancement.
