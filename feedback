How many JUnits were you able to get to pass? All

Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	Step 1: Javadocs were added to all methods utilized by the tests.

Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events?

The competition was pretty difficult to start since there was very little documention, but I supposed that is part of the challenge. I would like to see more small trials that test breadth rather than one big assignment.
